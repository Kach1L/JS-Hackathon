Hello Slava & Kachi,

Here's my feedback on your project. I've included some points for preservation and some points for improvement. I hope you find it helpful.

### Points for Preservation:
1. **DRY Code:** You've used Django's model and DRF serializers in an effective way, avoiding duplication of code.
2. **Asynchronous Frontend:** Your use of asynchronous functions in the front-end shows a good understanding of modern web programming paradigms.
3. **RESTful API**: The CRUD methods you've implemented are well-structured, adhering to REST principles.
4. **Error Handling**: The fetch API is wrapped inside try/catch to handle potential errors, which is a good practice.

### Points for Improvement:
1. **Consistency in Naming Conventions:** The function names and variable names should follow a consistent naming scheme. For example, `fetchData` and `option_all` don't share the same naming convention.
2. **Duplication of Code**: You have CRUD functions in views that are essentially duplicated for different models. Consider using a generic way to handle CRUD for various models.
3. **Comments & Documentation**: Inline comments are great for code clarity but avoid leaving commented-out lines of code, like the `// class ExtraSerializer`, that don't serve any purpose.
4. **Security**: You're using `@csrf_exempt`, which could potentially open up security risks. Make sure to handle CSRF tokens properly in production.
5. **Frontend Error Handling**: While you catch and log errors, you might want to display an error message to the user in the front-end.
6. **Separation of Concerns**: It's generally a good idea to separate the frontend and backend code into different repositories or at least into distinct directories.
